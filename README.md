# splunk-lab2

Objective

The Distributed Splunk Environment Lab project aimed to build a comprehensive distributed setup of Splunk. The primary focus was on deploying and configuring various Splunk components, including a Search Head, Indexers, Forwarders (Intermediate, Universal and Heavy), and a Deployment Server, to create a scalable and efficient environment for log collection and analysis. This lab was designed to improve my 'splunk-lab' project by adding Search Peer and Intermediate Forwarders and managing log forwarding with Deployment Server.

Skills Learned

- Proficiency in deploying and managing a distributed Splunk architecture, including Search Head, Indexers, and Forwarders.
- Practical experience in setting up and configuring Heavy Forwarders to enhance log ingestion workflows.
- Hands-on knowledge of ingesting data from Linux and Windows systems using Universal Forwarders.
- Understanding and implementation of various Splunk data input mechanisms, such as file monitoring, scripted inputs, and real-time network inputs.
- Practical knowledge of using a Deployment Server to centrally manage and configure Splunk Forwarders.

Tools Used

- Virtual Machines/Cloud: To simulate a distributed Splunk environment.
- Splunk Enterprise: For log management, indexing, and querying.
- Splunk Universal Forwarder: For collecting logs from endpoint systems and sending them to search peers.
- Splunk Heavy Forwarder: For preprocessing and advanced routing of log data.
- Deployment Server: For centralized configuration and management of Splunk Forwarders.
- VS Code: To connect and manage Linux and Windows servers.
