# splunk-lab2

Objective

The Distributed Splunk Environment Lab project aimed to build a comprehensive distributed setup of Splunk to explore its data ingestion and forwarding capabilities. The primary focus was on deploying and configuring various Splunk components, including a Search Head, Indexers, Forwarders (Universal, Intermediate, and Heavy), and a Deployment Server, to create a scalable and efficient environment for log collection and analysis. This lab was designed to experiment with diverse data input methods and understand how logs from different sources can be managed effectively.

Skills Learned

-Proficiency in deploying and managing a distributed Splunk architecture, including Search Head, Indexers, and Forwarders.
-Practical experience in setting up and configuring Intermediate and Heavy Forwarders to enhance log ingestion workflows.
-Hands-on knowledge of ingesting data from Linux and Windows systems using Universal Forwarders.
-Understanding and implementation of various Splunk data input mechanisms, such as file monitoring, scripted inputs, and real-time network inputs.
-Improved troubleshooting and optimization skills for distributed log ingestion pipelines.
-Practical knowledge of using a Deployment Server to centrally manage and configure Splunk Forwarders.

Tools Used

Virtual Machines: To simulate a distributed Splunk environment.
Splunk Enterprise: For log management, indexing, and querying.
Splunk Universal Forwarder: For collecting logs from endpoint systems.
Splunk Heavy Forwarder: For preprocessing and advanced routing of log data.
Deployment Server: For centralized configuration and management of Splunk Forwarders.
PuTTY: To connect and manage Linux and Windows servers.
